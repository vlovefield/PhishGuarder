# PhishGuarder
PhishGuarder is a Python tool designed to scan URLs from emails or lists for phishing characteristics. It successfully extracts URLs and checks for phishing indicators such as IP addresses, suspicious domain names, and URL length.

Phishing attacks use deceptive URLs to trick users into providing sensitive information. Organizations that receive thousands of emails daily are at risk of encountering malicious links. Automating the detection of phishing URLs can significantly reduce this risk. PhishGuarder helps automate this process, minimizing the chances of successful phishing attacks.

# Features
